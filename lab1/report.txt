For part 2, I chose to make a program which calculates the cross product of two three dimensional
vectors. The user is asked for each component (x, y, z) for each vector, and upon entering this
information, the program outputs a new vector which is the cross product. It is important to note
that the program only finds one of the possible cross product vectors, there is another cross 
product vector that is the inverse of the one calculated (if the calculated vector is v, the other
normal vector is equal to v * -1).

The program is relatively simple in its construction. It breaks each vector component (i, j, k)
into a separate variable. Then it requests the two vectors upon which the cross product will be
performed using a scanf() function. Finally, the program calculates the components of the resulting
vector and outputs it in the format <x, y, z>.

I evaluated the program for correctness by comparing it to other cross product calculator which
are known to be correct. There is a single case in which it produces incorrect results, which is
when the two vectors are parallel to eachother in which case there are infinitely many normal vectors
and the calculator returns the vector <0, 0, 0>.
