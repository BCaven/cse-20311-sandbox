How the ASCII Plot works from a user's perspective:
From the user's perspective, they enter the range and the program outputs a crude graph and table of the function on the range they specified. The user is unable to
change the equation, but they are able to see what the equation is. After the graph is finished processing, the program tells the user what the maximum and minimum
values were and at what x coordinates they occured.
How the ASCII Plot works from an internal perspective:
From an internal perspective, the program takes a hard-coded function, and runs it through a given range (starting at zero, until a user-specified stop coordinate).
It uses two for-loops: one is used to iterate the function through the range, and the other is used to produce the graph. It first calculates the y value at the x value
given to it by the for loop, then it runs the second for loop through the calculated y value, printing a "#" at each step. The program then checks if the calculated value
is either greater than the current maximum, or less than the current minimum. If either is true, the new maximum/minimum is set to that x, y pair.
After the program has finished iterating through the range, it prints the final maximum and minimum values.
How the output was verified:
The output was verified using the graphing tool "Desmos" which was previously known to be reliable.
